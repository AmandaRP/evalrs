## Installation

You can install {evalrs} from this repo with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_git("evalrs")
library(evalrs)
```

If the installation above is problematic, there are two alternative ways to install the package:

1. Pull this repo into RStudio and then run `devtools::load_all(reset=FALSE)` followed by `devtools::install()`, or
2. Click the "download" button on this GitLab repo page. Save the file as a `.tar.gz` file and upload it to RStudio. In RStudio, select "Install Packages" from the "Tools" drop-down menu. Choose "Package archive file" as the "Install from" option then browse to find the `.tar.gz` file. Click "install". 

After completing one of the above steps, run `library(evalrs)` to load the package.
